Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow
This project uses TensorFlow to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

🚀 Features:
Loads MNIST using tensorflow_datasets

Preprocesses and normalizes image data

Builds a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras

Trains and evaluates the model

Visualizes predictions and results

📁 Dataset:
MNIST: 28x28 grayscale images of digits 0–9
(60,000 training + 10,000 test images)

📊 Results:
Achieves ~98% accuracy on the test set

Visualizes predictions with labels and bounding boxes

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)

NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL
